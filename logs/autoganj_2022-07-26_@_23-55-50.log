There is a similar question to this on Hinduism.SE, but it was never properly answered.
The Puranas do not give the names of most of the trees and plants. The only exception I know, is the mention of the Tulsi plant in the Vishnu Purana. 
<blockquote>
<p>Pulomā, Ila, Durgā and Tara, <strong>Tulasi</strong>, Rohinī and Vaidūrya are
  seven. The seven mothers, Pulomā and the rest of them, have their
  abodes in the heaven of Indra; and the seven sons, who are their sons
  according to the Sattvas, have their abodes in Sālmalī.</p>
