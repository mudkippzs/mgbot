"I take it there's trouble?" Jarvis' response came quickly.

"Something like that," Tony answered, maneuvering outside onto a balcony. "How was the ball?"

"As you'd expect, sir. Governor Wilson arrived shortly after you left and wore quite the frown." Jarvis sounded amused, though not surprised. "His aides were busy most of the evening calming down those in attendance." A gust of wind caught his voice at the end.

Tony winced, wondering how long he'd been out in the storm without realizing it. He should have gotten up immediately after downloads were completed and gone inside. Instead he had just sat there thinking about Pepper and the fact that she hadn't called to tell him anything yet today. The wind picked up and pelted Tony with raindrops as he pondered what her first words would be when they talked again. "Jarvis, run a diagnostic please," Tony muttered, putting on an act for anyone who might happen to be watching below through high-powered binoculars or telescopes as he moved back inside out of the downpour as though nothing had happened. Though why anyone would bother spying on him right now was beyond him when all everyone wanted to know was where Steve was these days anyway. At least they weren't nagging him about his whereabouts constantly anymore since they thought whatever it was that had happened between Steve and Tony involved them both leaving town at roughly the same time two weeks```
