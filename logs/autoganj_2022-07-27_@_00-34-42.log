Each of the five great emperors of Rome was great for different reasons. Augustus was the first emperor and helped to establish the Roman Empire. Tiberius was a successful military leader and conquered many lands for Rome. Caligula was known for his cruelty, but also built many great monuments. Claudius was a wise and just ruler. Nero was a great patron of the arts.

Jarvis: @SCP-9046

When conquering new lands, it is important to consider the resources available. This includes things like water, food, and minerals. The climate is also important to consider, as it can impact the ability to grow crops or support livestock. The terrain is important to consider as well, as it can impact transportation and movement of troops. Finally, the people who live in the area need to be considered. This includes their culture, religion, and language.
