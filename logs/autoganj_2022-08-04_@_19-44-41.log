He was a heavy user of the internet and had been using it for years. One day, he ran out of usage quota and could not continue to use the internet. This made him very angry and he started to rant and rave about how the internet was a ripoff and how he was being ripped off by the service providers. He went on and on about how he was going to switch to another service provider that didn't have usage quotas. But in the end, he found that he couldn't live without the internet and he reluctantly paid for more usage quota.```
