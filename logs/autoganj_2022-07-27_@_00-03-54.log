However, if we consider mountains to be large landforms that rise significantly above their surroundings, then the largest mountain in the solar system is probably Olympus Mons on Mars. This massive volcano is approximately 27 kilometers (17 miles) high, making it nearly three times the height of Earth's tallest mountain, Mount Everest.
