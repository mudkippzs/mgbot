Age: 29
Backstory: Arwen is the daughter of Elrond and Celebrian, making her a granddaughter of Thingol through Luthien, and thus, a great-great-great-granddaughter of Melian the Maia. She was born in Rivendell and lived there until she was 87 years old. She then journeyed to Lothlorien with Galadriel, where she met and eventually married Celeborn. The two of them dwelt in Lothlorien for the next few centuries, until Aragorn came to Lothlorien during the War of the Ring. Arwen then went with him to Gondor, where she eventually became Queen.

Plot Hooks:
-Arwen is seeking a powerful magical artifact that her grandfather once possessed in order to help her husband in his fight against Sauron.
-Arwen is kidnapped by Sauron's forces and must be rescued before she can be used as a bargaining chip against her husband.
-As the War of the Ring rages on, Arwen must choose between her love for her husband and her duty to her people.```
