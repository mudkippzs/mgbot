"""
1. Create a Sentiment Analyzer using GPT3 that takes a text string as input and returns a json or tuple as output.
2. The output should be a structured set of values in the range of -1.0 to 1.0 and include the dimensions: joy, fear, disgust, sadness, anger, surprise.

JSON output example:
{ "joy": -0.9969352437035242, "fear": -0.4081494313347054, "disgust": -0.20717554409011085, "sadness": 0.7191569540831366, "anger": -0.46032758038040944, "surprise": -0.8758254105195562 }

Tuple output example: 
(0.5, 0.7, 0.3, -0.5, -0.8, 0.9)
